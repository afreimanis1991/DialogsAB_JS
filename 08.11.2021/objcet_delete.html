<h2>JavaScript Objects</h2>
<p>JavaScript objects are mutable.</p>
<p>Any changes to a copy of an object will also change the original object:</p>

<script>
const person = {
  firstName: "John",
  lastName: "Doe",
  age:50,
  eyeColor: "blue"
};

let txt = "";
for (let x in person) {
  console.log(x, typeof x);
  txt += person[x] + " ";
}

const x = person;
delete x.age;

txt = "";
for (let x in person) {
  console.log(x, typeof x);
  txt += person[x] + " ";
}
